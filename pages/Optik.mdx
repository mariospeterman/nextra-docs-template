**Optik's Onchain Channel (Profile & Handle): Own Your Data**

In the Optik ecosystem, users exercise absolute control over their data. By creating an onchain profile, individuals can set up permissions, govern their interactions, and manage their content with full autonomy. This system ensures that every user is the master of their digital footprint, moving it securely on the blockchain.

**INO/IDO and the Evolution of Optik**

The Initial NFT Offering (INO) and Initial Decentralized Offering (IDO) marked pivotal moments in Optik's journey. These phases were not just about fundraising but symbolized the democratization of content and the empowerment of creators. From the second year, the Silly Token becomes the exclusive medium of exchange, ensuring every transaction within Optik is seamless, secure, and in the hands of its community.
